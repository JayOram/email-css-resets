# email-css-resets
A repository to hold all CSS resets from past and present email clients.

Two main files - 

<a href="https://github.com/JayOram/email-css-resets/blob/main/old-CSS-resets.css"> Old CSS resets</a><br>
<a href="https://github.com/JayOram/email-css-resets/blob/main/CSS-resets.css"> Current CSS resets</a>

I would love anyone to send updates / pull requests with any CSS resets they find in old templates or know of?
